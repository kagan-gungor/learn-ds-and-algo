              number of operations, not the number of runs of algorithms. The reason we do this is that when\

             operations for the input size.(Binary search, divide and conquer solutions etc.)\
             \n 3. **Linear time complexity O(n)**: Here, time complexity will grow in direct proportion to the size of\
             input data. The best case is to try to keep our function running below or within this range of complexity.\
             \n 4. **Quadratic time complexity O(n^2)**: A quadratic time complexity often comes when there are two nested\
             loops in algorithm. Such situations occur mostly during matrix-based problems and brute force solutions\
